Ingredients:

>  * 10 russett (brown skin) potatoes, cooked, peeled and cut into 1-2" pieces
>  * 2 cups queso fresco, that should be one package, but if really small package, then use 2
>  * salt and pepper to taste
>  * 2 Tablespoons ground jalapeño pepper (reserve some of the ground peppers from ají before you mix in the olive oil etc)
>  * few drops of lemon juice
>  * 1 cup olive oil
>  * 6 hard boiled egg yolks
>  * 1/2 cup milk or half-and-half
>  * 1/4 cup onion, finely chopped and soaked in boiling water (sometimes I omit this step)
>  * 5 hard boiled eggs sliced (for garnish)
>  * 10 ripe olives (for garnish)
>  * lettuce leaves, lay potatoes on these (although I usually don't)
